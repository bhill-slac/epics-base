# P, M, and N combine to make the instance's name.
# N contains the specific motor.
# DTYP is the motor driver name for our motors.
# C is controller; this links to the ASYN port
#   ASYN gives digi port a name
#   MDrivePlusConfig maps digi name to controller #.
# ACCL is the time to accelerate from the base speed to full speed.
# DIR is the direction of rotation, "Pos" or "Neg"

# SREV (not shown) is the number of steps per revolution is 200 by
#    default
#

# 
# For SREV:
#    2048 = internal encoder (EQ)
#     250 = external encoder, NUMERIK-JENA
#     200 = external encoder, Renishaw
#   51200 = no encoder

# NOTE: Soft limits (DHLM & DLLM) may be better off using HLM & LLM and relying on autosave to keep those than loading them into the database everytime.
# If the motor is reversed in DIR, then the DHLM and HLM are reveresed which makes it difficult to accurately set the soft limits.
# (Dial) DHLM 140, DLLM 2 is equivalent to (User) HLM -2, LLM -140
