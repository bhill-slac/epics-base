# Which ARM instruction set(s) to generate code for:
#   Most iOS devices can run programs compiled for both the
#   ARMv6 and ARMv7 instruction sets. ARMv7 code is usually
#   more efficient, but the older devices listed below can only
#   use the ARMv6 instruction set. Including both architectures
#   generates a Universal binary, which is larger and takes
#   longer to compile but runs efficiently on all devices.
#
#   ARMv6-only devices: iPhone 1 or 3G, iPod Touch Gen 1 or 2
#
ARCH_CLASS = armv7
#ARCH_CLASS = armv6 armv7
#ARCH_CLASS = armv6


# Uncomment these two definitions to use g++ instead of clang++
# which may be needed in some circumstances:
#
#CCC = $(GNU_BIN)/c++
#GNU_LDLIBS_YES = -lgcc
